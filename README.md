## 📜 Project Overview

The manual application of refractory lining inside a tundish is a hazardous, time-consuming, and inconsistent process. This project presents a complete automated solution using an industrial robot to improve safety, increase efficiency, and ensure a uniform lining thickness. We handled the entire project lifecycle, from problem analysis and component selection to 3D design and path simulation.

## ✨ Key Features & Objectives

- **Problem Analysis:** Identified the key drawbacks of the manual process, including safety risks and quality inconsistencies.
- **System Design:** Developed a complete 3D model of the robotic work cell, including the tundish and robot, using SolidWorks.
- **Component Selection:**
    - **Robot:** Selected the Universal Robots **UR20** for its reach, payload capacity, and precision.
    - **Nozzle:** Chose a specialized spray nozzle suitable for refractory materials.
- **Path Planning & Simulation:** Programmed and validated the robot's operational toolpath in MATLAB to ensure complete and even coverage of the tundish interior.
- **Automation Proof-of-Concept:** Successfully demonstrated the feasibility of automating this critical industrial process.
